      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        I am a self-taught, Javascript and front-end developer with a Bachelor's degree in Accounting. Learning new technologies and programming complex spreadsheets to achieve results were always my favorite part of Accounting; moving into programming has been a satisfying transition.<br>
        I am adaptive and can work well both independently and as a part of a team. My number one goal is to always provide value to the company and to customers

      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Todo App<em> - React JS</em></strong> <br>
        I created this app in ReactJS using the new/experimental Hooks feature. Hooks made the state management easier to implement by simplifying state initiation and updating. Because state isnt only bound to classes and can be implemented in functional components, this closure is more predictable and function binding can be skipped. I used local storage and the new Hooks lifecycle method useEffect() to store user data. This was my first time creating a CRUD app in React without the guide of a course or tutorial and I am very proud of the results. One challenge I overcame was knowing when to save state to local storage
        <br><br>
        <strong>Landing Page w/ Multiple Themes<em> - React JS</em></strong> <br>
        In this project I took a responsive HTML/SCSS webpage I coded, ported it to React, and added support for multiple themes. After transitioning the original HTML to multiple components, I extracted all reference to color in the CSS and made it into one shared state object theme. To make the code easier to read I defined an array of themes in a seperate file. A difficulty I had to overcome when making this change was how to make the SVGs transition along with the themes. SVGs of a single color were able to transition by passing through an inline fill property, though SVGs with more than one color were more complex. I made these into their own component.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Demo Landing Pages<em> - HTML/SCSS</em></strong><br>
        Multiple landing pages I created with design specifications from Frontendmentor.io. With only minimal assets (style guide, decorative SVGs, JPEG of final design) I code a fully responsive web page, optimized for both desktop and mobile. Doing these repeated challenges increased my skill and speed. I appreaciated the real-world workflow simulated by Frontend Mentor. My final projects have been featured in multiple newsletters and I contribute to their Slack channel often so I also can help nudge new developers into the right direction
