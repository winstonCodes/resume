      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        I am a self-taught Javascript and front-end developer with a Bachelor's degree in Accounting. Learning new technologies and programming complex spreadsheets to help my department achieve results were my favorite part of my Accounting experience. Moving into programming has been a satisfying transition.<br>
        I am adaptive and can work well both independently and as a part of a team. My number one goal is to maximize value for the company and customers.

        This app was written in ReactJS using the new/experimental Hooks feature. I made this choice because Hooks makes the code easier to read by allowing for stateful functional components and a simplified state getting and setting process. Because state isnt only bound to classes and can be implemented in functional components, "this" closure is more predictable and function binding is skipped. I used local storage and the new lifecycle method useEffect() to store user data after the component updates. I am very proud of the results and use this app on my mobile often.

        In this project I took a responsive HTML/SCSS webpage I coded, ported it to React, and added support for multiple themes. After transitioning the original HTML into React components, I extracted all reference to color in the CSS, compiled it into a state object, and passed it into the components as props. To make the code easier to read I defined my array of themes in a seperate file. A difficulty I had to overcome when making this project was making the SVGs transition along with the themes.
        Single color icons are able to transition by passing through a uniform fill property, though SVGs with more than one color needed to take multiple color props that were applied to their JSX as template literals in order to match each theme.

        I created multiple landing pages with design specifications given from Frontendmentor.io. With only minimal assets (style guide, decorative SVGs) I mirrored the JPEGs of the final design. Doing these repeated challenges increased my speed and skill in optimizing responsive web pages. I chose to do these challenges because I appreciated the simulated real-world workflow. My final projects have been featured in multiple newsletters and I continue to contribute to their Slack channel often because I enjoy helping nudge new developers into the right direction.
